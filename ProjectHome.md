The goal of this project is to create a standalone multi platform gmail client based on xulrunner.

**Features**

  * an independant task for gmail (e.g. if FF crashes)
  * SSL mode
  * password manager from firefox
  * inbuilt greasemonkey framework to utilize gmscripts
  * included debugging tools (js console, venkman, , extension developer extension, dom inspector (partly working))
  * theme and extension manager (but not working)
  * a warm fuzzy feeling
  * external links launch in default browser
  * download manager working

There are tons of ideas which I'm hoping to implement like minimize to tray, notifications, maybe even some kind of offline support and whatnot.
